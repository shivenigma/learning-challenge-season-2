# Learning Challenge - Season 2
## Day 1
1) Python syntax - multi line strings, used it to print an ascii art in terminal using stdout
2) Python syntax - `input()` function to collect input from user through `stdin`
3) Python syntax - Arithmetic operations, especially the `//` syntax to get rounded division value
4) Python syntax - Python doesn't have switch statement and I have to find a workaround or live with if..else if
